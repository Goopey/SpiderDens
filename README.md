### New Web-Themed Items

### A titular Spider Den which can do many things :
* Spawns spiders in the dark

* Can feed on bones to spawn spider jockeys
* Can eventually turn into a dungeon with custom loot
* Can rarely spawn at night on the surface
* Never despawn until they're cleared
* Can spawn in caves at all times
* Some larger spider dens spawn during world generation

### New spiders : 
* Spiderlings (small and cute, purely decorative, spawns in caves and around Dens)
* Red Spiders (immune to fire damage)
* Hell Spiders (immune to fire damage, larger, stronger, set player on fire)
* Blue Spiders (immune to suffocation, status effects and can swim very well)
* Yellow Spiders (prioritises strafing the player)
* Armored Spiders (resistant to melee attacks, anvils, fall damage)
* Blessed Spiders (apply buffs to spiders near them like regeneration + strength, invisibility or speed)
* Black Recluses (bigger cave spiders that apply Wither)
* Behemoths (very large spiders with tons of health and armor)
* Red Behemoth (see above)
* Blue Behemoth (see above)
* Yellow Behemoth (see above)
* Wolfspiders (larger, hairy spiders which can sneak and lunge at their targets)
* Red Wolfspiders (larger, red-haired spiders which can sneak and shoot many poisonous bolts at their targets)

### Mega Jockeys
Behemoth-spiders can spawn with 4 skeletons on their backs and are equipped with a massive arbalest on their shoulder which shoot Behemoth Arrows.

### Wolfspider Ressurection
Wolfspiders can be resurrected by other wolfspiders or blessed spiders within a minute of their death as long as they didn't take fire damage.

### A Bane of Arthropods buff :
* Bane of Arthopods now ignores fire immunity, making red spiders and hell spiders take fire damage from Fire Aspect.
* Bane of Arthopods now ignores damage resistances and armor on spiders weakening Behemoths and Armored Spiders significantly.
* Bane of Arthopods now give slowness 4 to spiders which apply poisons like the Black Recluses, Red Wolfspiders and Cave Spiders for 12 seconds.

### A Honey buff :
* Honey now clears poison and fire.
* Honey now also lowers the level of Wither when drinking it, clearing it if the status effect is at its minimum.

## Invasion Mode.
Invasion Mode is a new way of playing the game.
Spiders Dens commonly spawn in bundles in the world and never despawn and spiders swarm the player.

### Features unique to this mode :
* Large Spider Den Bundles which spawn together in the world.
* Spider Den defense. Attacking a Spider Den will aggravate all nearby spider dens, causing them to retaliate by spawning many spiders.
* Common evolution traits. Every spider nest will be able to spawn stronger spider types.
* Spider Senses. Spiders will be able to track and detect how much light a player is making, making them progressively stronger and will make them send out larger and larger swarms at the player.
* Spider can break blocks, but can't climb.

## Arachnophobia Mode.
No Spiders Dens can spawn and natural spider spawns are replaced with Frogs.

## Config
The config will be used to determine if Invasion Mode is on and what parts of the mod is active.

It will be possible to :
* Turn off parts of the honey buff (increase amount of levels of wither it clears, if it clears fire as well, etc...)
